      <h2>Jungle Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
      <p>
        The Jungle Book is an 1894 collection of stories by the English author
        Rudyard Kipling. Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan
        the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the boy or
        "man-cub" Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. Most stories
        are set in a forest in India; one place mentioned repeatedly is
        "Seeonee" (Seoni), in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. A major theme
        in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of
        Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. The theme is echoed in the
        triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal
        over their enemies, as well as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of
        law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less
        about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in
        animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing
        one's place in society with "the law of the jungle", but the stories
        also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as
        when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also
        noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories,
        reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.
        <br />
        The Jungle Book has remained popular, partly through its many
        adaptations for film and other media. Critics such as Swati Singh have
        noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism
        have admired the power of his storytelling.[1] The book has been
        influential in the scout movement, whose founder, Robert Baden-Powell,
        was a friend of Kipling.[2] Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book
        Cycle around quotations from the book. Rudyard Kipling's stories were
        first printed in magazines in 1893 and 1894;<br />
        the original publications also contained hand-sketched illustrations,
        with some from John Lockwood Kipling, his father. Rudyard himself was
        born in Mumbai—then referred to as Bombay—in the western coastal Indian
        state of Maharashtra, where he spent his first six years of life. After
        around 10 years back in England, and having completed his schooling,
        Kipling went back to India to work for nearly 6½ years. Later on, his
        original stories would be written when he lived at Naulakha, the
        property and home he owned in Dummerston, Vermont, US.[3] There is
        evidence that Kipling wrote the collection of stories for his daughter,
        Josephine (who died from pneumonia in 1899, aged 6); a first-edition
        copy of the book—including a handwritten note by the author to his young
        daughter—was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall,
        Cambridgeshire, in 2010. The tales in the book (as well as those in The
        Second Jungle Book, which followed in 1895 and includes eight further
        stories, including five about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an
        anthropomorphic manner to teach moral lessons. The verses of "The Law of
        the Jungle", for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals,
        families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew
        or "heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle". Other readers have
        interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the
        time
